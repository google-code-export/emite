==Basic concepts==

===Emite modules===
Emite is divided in modules. Each module registers a series of components inside a container
(using the Suco library http://suco.googlecode.com).
You can access the any registered component using the Suco facade. For example, to retrieve
a xmpp session component you should use this code:
{{{
Session session = Suco.get(Session.class);
}}}

The only thing you have to do is inherit the modules you need in your <AppName>.gwt.xml file:
{{{
<module>
  <inherits name="com.calclab.emite.core.EmiteCore" />
  <inherits name="com.calclab.emite.im.EmiteIM" />
  <inherits name="com.calclab.emite.xep.muc.EmiteMUC" />

  ...
</module>
}}}

Currently the following modules are completely developed:
  * Core: com.calclab.emite.core.EmiteCore
  * InstantMessaging: com.calclab.emite.im.EmiteIM
  * Multi-user chats: com.calclab.emite.xep.muc.EmiteMUC

===Callbacks===
Because the asynchronous nature of xmpp communications, you usually perform actions in two stages:
first you send a request and then you listen for that request to complete. To attach a listener
(callback) to a component use the onXXX methods of that component.


For example, to perform a login you usually write this code:
{{{
  Session session = Suco.get(Session.class);

  // attach a callback to the LoggedIn event
  session.onLoggedIn(Callback<XmppURI>() {
    public void onEvent(XmppURI user) {
      // some code here
    }
  });

  // request to login
  session.login(XmppURI.uri("userName@domain"), "password");
  // at this point, the login process is not completed!
}}}

===Packets===
Xmpp communications are xml intensive. IPacket is a interface to query a xml response. Also you can
use the Packet class (or any of its child classes: Presence, Message, IQ) to create xml in a friendly way:

{{{
  Session session = Suco.get(Session.class);
  Message message = new Message("send this");
  session.send(message);
}}}

this is not exaclty valid code: for example, you should wait until the session is ready
(and you know when is ready attaching a callback to the session)


== Core module ==

The core module register the following components:
  * A xmpp connection component (com.calclab.emite.core.client.bosh.Connection)
  * A xmpp session component (com.calclab.emite.core.client.xmpp.Session)

===Connection component ===

You need to configure the connection component before anything else. The connection object
require two parameters:
  * The httpBase: the url of the xmpp bosh service (remember: due the same origin policy of browsers, the url should be relative of the page where the client is loaded from)
  * The server domain name

Using the emite browser module (not documented here :-( ) you can skip this configuration process.

Here is an example of how to configure the session component:
{{{
  Connection connection = Suco.get(Connnection.class);
  connection.setSettings(new Bosh3Settings("httpBase", "domain"));
}}}

===Session component===

The session is the main component of emite. You can send and receive stanzas (xmpp valid xml fragments),
login, logout, pause/resume the connection, track the session state... see javadocs for more info.

You already seen a example of how to login into a session.

== !InstantMessaging module==

This module register the following components:
  * A !ChatManager that helps to use different conversations at the same time
  * A !Roster component to manage the user's contacts
  * A !PresenceManager to change your own presence
  * A !PresenceSubscriptionManager that handles (automatically or not, you can choose ;-) ) the subscription issues
